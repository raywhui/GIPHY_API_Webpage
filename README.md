# Avocado Toast: The Millenial GIF Generator

When money is not being placed into a bank account, you can hear the distant sound of a millenial, eating the fruit of its generation: Avocados. Known for not saving money to put into property, these creatures will stop at nothing to spend $10+ on avocado toast, the lifeblood of their hivemind, Instagram. TO turly understand these dangerous monstrousities, an app was created to attempt to communicate with them. This is an app that generates GIFs using the GIPHY API and searches for the things that millenials find most dear to them. Are you brave enough to step into this world full of filters, spoiled children, and avocados?

## How It Works

Millenials are quite difficult to understand. Luckily, this app isn't. You click on one of the buttons on top and it will generate the first 10 GIFs related to that word. The image will be still, so if you click on the polaroids, they will start to move. Simply click on them again to have them stop. You can also add new buttons to the list by typing it into the input bar on the right. There is also a Twitter feed of anyone who puts in the hashtag #avocadotoast, so you can track any of those sneaky millenials.
